<em>Writting my own wc Unix tool</em>

## About

Following the guidelines of the [Coding Challenges blog](https://codingchallenges.fyi/), the goal of this project is the development of a proprietary version of the Unix command line tool wc

The wc command is used to count the number of lines, words and bytes in a text file passed as a parameter. On the other hand, if no text file is specified, the command will read from the standard input.

## Set up

Download the application repository:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/mariollesta/my-own-wc.git
```

> Note: It will be downloaded to the directory where we are located in our terminal by executing the command

Install the packages:

- To install the package locally in the user's directory, which means that it will only be available to the user who performed the installation

```terminal
pip install --user <PATH>/mywc-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
```

- To install the package globally on the system, which means that it will be available to all users on the system. May require elevated (administrative) permissions to install the package.

```terminal
pip install <PATH>/mywc-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
```

> Note: If the program does not work, check that the directory where the executable is located is in the PATH variable of the system.
