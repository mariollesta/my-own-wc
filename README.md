## Summary 

Following the guidelines of the Write Your Own wc Tool project of the [Coding Challenges blog](https://codingchallenges.fyi/), the goal of this project is the development my own version of the Unix wc tool.

The wc command is used to count the number of lines, words and bytes in a text file passed as a parameter. On the other hand, if no text file is specified, the command will read from the standard input.
