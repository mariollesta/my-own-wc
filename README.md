## Summary 

Following the guidelines of the [Coding Challenges blog](https://codingchallenges.fyi/), the goal of this project is the development of a proprietary version of the Unix command line tool wc

The wc command is used to count the number of lines, words and bytes in a text file passed as a parameter. On the other hand, if no text file is specified, the command will read from the standard input.
